### 🧾 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Registration & Risk Evaluation
Hands-on project focused on evaluating a personal endpoint for enterprise BYOD approval by documenting hardware specifications, operating system security, patch compliance, and alignment with industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project demonstrates how a personal device can be assessed for **corporate network eligibility** by applying security, compliance, and risk-based thinking commonly used by IT and cybersecurity teams.

The goal was to determine whether a personal laptop meets **enterprise security standards** required for BYOD environments.

## 🖥️ My Device Overview
- 💻 **Device Type:** Laptop (Dell Inspiron 15 3520)
- 🏭 **Manufacturer:** Dell
- 🧠 **Architecture:** Intel x64-based system  
- ⚙️ **CPU:** 10 cores / 12 logical processors @ 1.7 GHz  
- 🧮 **Memory:** 64 GB SODIMM RAM (2/2 slots used)  
- 💾 **Storage:** 1.86 TB NVMe SSD (RAID-managed)  
- 🖥️ **Display:** 15.6” Full HD (1920 × 1080)  
- 🎥 **Webcam:** Integrated (720p)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Operating System & Platform
- 🪟 **OS:** Microsoft Windows 11 Pro (Build 26100)
- 🌐 **Locale:** en-US (Eastern Time)
- 🔐 **Security Features:** BitLocker support, Group Policy, Windows Defender integration
- 🧭 **Firmware:** UEFI-only (legacy boot disabled)

This operating system supports enterprise-grade management, encryption, and policy enforcement required in modern corporate environments.

---

## 🔐 Security Software & Endpoint Protection
- 🛡️ **Primary Antivirus:** Avast Antivirus  
- 🔄 **Status:** Active and fully updated  
- 🧪 **Virus Definitions:** Current as of June 2, 2025  
- 🧱 **Layered Protection:** Windows Security enabled (firewall + health monitoring)

No active threats were detected, and all protection modules were verified as operational.

---

## 🔄 Patch Management & Baseline Configuration
The device was confirmed to be fully patched with recent security updates, including:
- 🧩 **KB5058411** — May 2025 Windows 11 cumulative security update  
- 🦠 **KB890830** — Malicious Software Removal Tool (x64)  
- 🔌 **Driver Updates:** Realtek Bluetooth security update

Regular patching aligns with **NIST SP 800-53** system maintenance and vulnerability management controls.

---

## 🌐 Networking & Hardware Compatibility
- 📡 **Wireless:** 802.11ac Wi-Fi (Realtek 8821CE)
- 🔗 **Ports:** USB 3.1, Bluetooth, UEFI-only firmware
- ❌ **Thunderbolt:** Not present (not required for this environment)
- 🔒 **MAC Address:** Documented for network registration

The device supports secure wireless connectivity and modern, legacy-free firmware standards.

---

## 📊 Compliance & Industry Alignment
This endpoint aligns with:
- ✅ **NIST SP 800-53** — Patch management & endpoint security
- ✅ **CIS Benchmarks** — OS hardening and antivirus enforcement
- ✅ **Enterprise BYOD best practices** — Device control, updates, and layered defense

UEFI-only boot reduces exposure to boot-level malware and rootkits.

---

## 🧰 Productivity & Enterprise Software
- 🗂️ Microsoft Office Suite:
  - Word
  - Excel
  - Outlook
  - PowerPoint
  - Access
  - Publisher

These applications ensure compatibility with standard enterprise workflows and cloud-based collaboration platforms.

---

## 🧠 Risk Assessment Summary
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Justification:**
- Strong hardware performance
- Fully patched operating system
- Active antivirus and firewall protections
- Compliance with recognized security frameworks

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation
Based on performance capability, security posture, patch compliance, and adherence to industry standards, this device is **well-suited for BYOD deployment**.

Approval is recommended contingent on:
- Continued patch management
- Active antivirus protection
- Ongoing compliance with organizational BYOD policies
